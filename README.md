# General information
This rom was created using modification techniques older than my grandmother. All system apps were also deodexed and zip-aligned. I also removed some unnecessary files and anti-piracy files. Superuser is from Koushikdutta, I think it's the V16 version. The app store is Aurora Store and F-Droid. The rom does not have Google Play Services and soon we will be changing the default webview to another one like Bromite.

Now, let me be brutally honest here: I wouldn't recommend anyone in their right mind to use this ROM for anything remotely resembling productivity. In fact, I'm pretty sure my shit is more useful than this thing. But hey, where's the fun in playing it safe, right?

So, why am I even bothering to release this dumpster fire of a ROM, you ask? Well, folks, I have a confession to make: I'm addicted. Addicted to the thrill of tweaking code, endlessly tinkering with settings, and seeing just how many ways I can break my own device. It's like a twisted game of digital Jenga, and I just can't stop playing.

But fear not, brave souls! While I can't promise you a smooth sailing experience, I can guarantee one thing: I'll be here, burning the midnight oil (and probably a few brain cells along the way), tirelessly working on this ROM 24/7, 365 days a year. So, feel free to dive in, test the waters, and report back with all the bugs, glitches, and inevitable moments of sheer hilarity.

# Issues
If you notice something in the rom not working, or buggy, or root problems, please report it! I urge you to thoroughly test this rom! I'll probably be working on this rom 24/7 and every few days I will release updates with MANY improvements and modifications to improve your experience.

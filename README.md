# General information
This rom was created using modification techniques older than my grandmother. All system apps were also deodexed and zip-aligned. I also removed some unnecessary files and anti-piracy files. Superuser is from Koushikdutta, I think it's the V16 version. The app store is Aurora Store and F-Droid. The rom does not have Google Play Services and soon we will be changing the default webview to another one like Bromite.



# Issues
If you notice something in the rom not working, or buggy, or root problems, please report it! I urge you to thoroughly test this rom! I'll probably be working on this rom 24/7 and every few days I will release updates with MANY improvements and modifications to improve your experience.

# SharpROM-VMOS
A custom rom created for the VMOS app. Privacy-focused ROM, FOSS appstore and AOSP apps+design.

# Attention
Please use this ROM only on VMOS 2.9.0 version as it has only been fully tested on that version. In the latest versions of VMOS, problems with root can occur.

# General information
This rom was created using modification techniques older than my grandmother. All system apps were also deodexed and zip-aligned. I also removed some unnecessary files and anti-piracy files. Superuser is from Koushikdutta, I think it's the V16 version. The app store is Aurora Store and F-Droid. The rom does not have Google Play Services and soon we will be changing the default webview to another one like Bromite.
